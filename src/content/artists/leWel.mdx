description: "<p>Huhu; I'm Leander, born in 2001, currently residing in my hometown Rostock, Germany.
I got into music production in 2018, after my passion for DnB finally took over me. 2022 was a pivotal year for me, as I began playing my first live shows on various stages. </p>

<p>My sound resides in the evolving realm of modern, heavy DnB, a category yet to be fully defined within the scene. I love chaotic and overpowering sounds, made by my stupidly long fx chains… please never look at them, I‘d be embarrassed. </p>

<p>Fun fact: I'm performing my shows without shoes on (very devilish). If you try it for yourself, be sure to have a dedicated pair of socks tho - they're bound to get pretty dirty.</p>"
