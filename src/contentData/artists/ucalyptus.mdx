description: "<p>I’m a non-binary creator who’s been making music since 2014.</p>

<p>I don't see myself in just one genre, as music has much more to offer and one should always try out. However, Pop, Lofi and Chill Trap are the genres that most of my music falls into. </p>

<p>My style is soft and upbeat at the same time as well as very melodic.</p>"
