description: "<p>I’m changing and experimenting with my sound quite frequently, as I'm still within a steep learning progress. Apart from that, I would describe my style as chaotic, passionate and bass heavy :)</p>

<p>After starting to produce music, I settled on DnB as my main focus. A significant step for me as an artist was creating my alias “leWel” by merging my first and last name. 2022 was a special year for me, as I played my first live sets on different stages.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: I love penguins so much!! They are my favorite animals and I even integrated one into my logo.</p>"
