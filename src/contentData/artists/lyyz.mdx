description: "<p>I mainly produce trap, trap metal and dubstep, with various styles ranging from uplifting to ‚Äúsadboy‚Äù to grunge/hardcore.</p>

<p>It has always been my preference to be discovered by others. Hence, my music is there for those who stumble across. It is a passion, just not a priority.</p>


<p>I inconsistently go with the flow.  I also have vocal works in progress. ü§´</p>"
