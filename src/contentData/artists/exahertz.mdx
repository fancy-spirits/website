description: "<p>While my main genres are Hardcore, Trance, Dubstep and Techno, I also dive into Breakbeat, DnB, Future Bass and Doujin.</p>

<p>I love art - for me, real art is taking rules apart and creating something new. I want to find a sound that doesnâ€™t exist yet.  My music is experimental and sometimes a bit chaotic, but I make music I want to hear.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: EXAHERTZ, or \"Ehz\", stands for 10<sup>18</sup>, or the number of elements I feel there are in one of my tracks.</p>"
