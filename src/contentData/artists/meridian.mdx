description: "<p>Most of my Music falls into the genres of Kawaii Future Bass, Future Funk, Hardcore, Melodic Dubstep or Electro House.</p>

<p>While not sad nor happy, I aim for a middle ground between those two. I would call it bittersweet. My music focuses on experiencing strong emotions and narratives.</p>

<p>I take a lot of inspiration from Japanese games and media for my progressions and melodic storytelling, while I also like to add a flare of heavy bass music now and then for contrast.</p>


<p>In middle school I would always get blown away by this other student who took piano classes and played classical music in front of the class during the recess. My skills were nothing compared to hers... That's why I've put years of work into getting where I am today.</p>

<p>Also, turns out handing your kid a toy piano does things to it.</p>"
